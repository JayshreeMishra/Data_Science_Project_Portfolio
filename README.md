# ðŸ—º Jayshree's Portfolio

### Welcome to my data portfolio!

Explore a compilation of my projects in the realm of Data Science, Here, I showcase various projects that cover all aspects of a data scientist's journey, including the stages of business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, deployment, and dashboard creation.

## 1. Predict the Diagnosis of a Breast Cancer Patient

This project serves as a case study for the Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction Model. You can find the project [here](link_to_project).

- **Business Understanding:**
  - Explores the initial step in the Data Science Methodology.
  - Demonstrates the application of data science practices at each stage to address the identified business problem.

## 2. Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

### Overview

This project involves extracting and visualizing stock data for Tesla and GameStop. The data is obtained using the yfinance library and web scraping for historical stock prices and revenue data, respectively. Visualizations are created using plotly for an interactive and informative presentation.

## 3. Chicago Data Analysis with SQLite

### Introduction

This project analyzes three datasets from the city of Chicago using SQLite. It delves into the city's data to extract insights and patterns.

## 4. Insurance Cost Analysis

### Project Overview

An analysis of an insurance cost dataset using Python and various data analysis tools. The dataset includes information about individuals, such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

## 5. Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia (Data Visualization)

### Introduction

This project involves the analysis and visualization of historical wildfire data in Australia. The dataset includes information on various aspects of wildfires, such as the region, date, estimated fire area, mean estimated fire brightness, and more.

## 6. SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction: A Data Science Capstone Project

### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the landing success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage rockets. The process involves data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling. The project utilizes a variety of technologies and tools, including HTTP requests, Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation, SQL for analysis, and machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and KNN for prediction.

## 7. Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Data

### Overview

In this project, we delve into the realm of retail data analysis, aiming to extract meaningful insights to support critical business decisions. As an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, our focus is on unraveling patterns and trends hidden within transactional data.

## Statistical Data Visualization with Seaborn

### Overview

This project employs the statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, to discover and explore relationships in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the application of a boosted decision tree classifier with XGBoost to classify tumors as either malignant or benign.

Feel free to explore each project for a deeper understanding of the methodologies and insights gained.
