# üéóÔ∏è Predict the Diagnosis of a Breast Cancer Patient

This Project is a case study of my project Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction Model you can check out the project [Here](https://github.com/JayshreeMishra/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20Cancer%20Prediction)

**Business Understanding stage** marks the initial step in the **Data Science Methodology**
In this project, I leveraged the business problem to demonstrate my understanding of the Business Understanding stage.
Assuming the role of a data scientist,
I articulated how I applied data science methodology practices at each of the listed stages to address the identified business problem.


### Question to be solved

**Can we automatically predict the diagnosis of a breast cancer patient using computed features from cell nucleus images?**

To address the formulated question, five essential steps must be completed: 
Analytic Approach, Data Requirements, Data Collection, Data Understanding and Preparation, and Modeling and Evaluation.

### 1. Analytical Approach:
       Employing a Predictive Approach to predict the patient's diagnosis based on the features of the cell nucleus.
   
### 2. Data Requirements:
       Identifying initial symptoms and gathering data from mammogram tests, ultrasound, and other imaging tests.
   
### 3. Data Collection:
       Gathering features of cell nuclei, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity,
       concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
   
### 4. Data Understanding and Preparation:
     In the data understanding stage, defining the target (diagnosis) and features (radius, texture, symmetry, etc., of the nuclei) from the dataset.
     In the data preparation stage, identifying and handling any missing values and eliminating duplicate values of the defined features.
   
### 5. Modeling and Evaluation:
    In the modeling stage, selecting a predictive model like Logistic Regression.
    For model evaluation, splitting the data using the train-test split method and assessing accuracy, precision, recall, 
    and F1-score for cancer prediction.
